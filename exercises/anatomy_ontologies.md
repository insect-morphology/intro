# 10 Anatomy ontologies

* Use [Ontobee](http://www.ontobee.org/)
* Besides the title of the ontology, how can you determine if an ontology is a gross anatomy ontology?
* Choose ~1-3 ontologies from this list below
* Check the metadata on these ontologies:
  * When were they created?
  * When was the ontology last updated?
  * Is there an indication of the tools used to create the ontology?
  * How do you look "inside" an ontology?
* Inside each of the ontology:
  * Are there deprecated terms, how many?
  * Are there definitions for terms?
  * How many object properties are referenced in each ontology?
  * How many other ontologies are imported or cross-referenced?
